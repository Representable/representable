The Representable Docs are built with Docusaurus. For a detailed explanation of customizing Docusaurus sites, visit the [Docusaurus website](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction). However, the guide below will help you get started with some key features including editing a page and adding a new one.

### Editing a Page

Scroll to the bottom of each page in the docasaurus and click `edit this page`. If you have access to editing the docs, you will be taken to a page to edit them. Then, you can commit directly to the main branch.

### Adding a Page

#### 1. Add to the Sidebar

Go to `sidebars.js` and find the section that you want to add to. For example I may decide that I want to add a new doc called `django3` to the `Django Project` section.

Then, I would add `django3` to the end of the line as shown:

```
module.exports = {
  someSidebar: {
    ...
    "Django Project": ["django1", "django2","django3"],
    ...
  },
};
```

#### 2. Create Markdown File

After completing the above step, add a file in the docs folder called `django3.md`.

This file should have the following lines:

```
---
id: django3
title: Overview
sidebar_label: Overview
---

### Title
Anything you want here!

```
