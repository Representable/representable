### Project Structure

The Django project has one central app called `main`. You'll notice there's a `representable` folder - this mostly contains the settings and central `urls.py` file. Futhermore, there's a `docs` folder (a separate React app). For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll mainly discuss the `main` folder.

#### Django `main` Structure

The `main` application is structured as listed below. Here's some quick definitions that cover the most important files and folders:

- `static`: where images, js files, and css files are stored
- `templates`: HTML files that serve all of these files
- `views` : Creates views that serve templates, optionally with content from the database.
- `urls.py`: Handles `url` routing and displays the views.
- `models.py`: Where Database models are created
- `forms.py`: Where custom forms are created
- `test.py`: Where the unit tests go

```

```

The templates and views folders are structured into four main categories:

- `drives`: public templates/views for drives launched by organizations
- `dashboard`: private templates/views for managing submissions and launching drives.
- `partners`: public templates/views for organization/partner pages
- `pages`: static pages
