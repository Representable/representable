title: Postgres Installation
---

This tutorial will guide you through the installation of Postgres, a relational database.

## On MacOS

### 1. Run the following command from Terminal to download Postgres

```
brew install postgresql
```

### 2. Download Postgres.app

Install the Postgres.app client from: https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html. Choose the first download option: Postgres.app with PostgreSQL 12.

### 3. Open Postgres.app and start a Postgres server

Use the default settings on Port 5432.

### 4. Add Postgres.app path to your local `PATH`

Type:
```
psql --version
```
The output of the command will be something like `psql (PostgreSQL) 12.3`. You'll use this version to set the Postgres path.

Next, write:

```
nano ~/.bash_profile
```
Then copy this line into the .bash_profile after changing X.Y to your Postgres version (e.g. 12.3):

```
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/X.Y/bin
```

Finally, to save the file press `Ctrl-X` then `Y`. Restart your terminal for changes to go into effect.


### 5. Open Terminal and run:

```
psql postgres
```

### 6. Next, run the following lines to create the local database, after modifying the first line to include the proper DB password:

```
CREATE USER representable WITH encrypted password 'INSERT PASSWORD HERE';
ALTER ROLE representable WITH CREATEDB;
CREATE DATABASE representable_db WITH OWNER representable;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE representable_db to representable;
```

## On Linux/Windows
