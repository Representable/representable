title: Non-Technical Setup
---

Here's some information for setting up the non-technical side of Representable.

Many of these are links which will be personally given out in order to keep them private, but use this checklist to ensure that you get connected to everything.

### Representable Groupchat
We use Messenger for casual discussion + logistics. You should be added to the group by a current member.

### Slack
We also communicate via the Princeton Gerrymandering Project slack, particularly with the folks at PGP (Hannah, Jason, and Indraneel are who we have the most contact with). There's a few channels that it will be good for yall to join:

 - /#representable : general discussion on Representable. Links, contacts, anything goes here!
 - /#representable-dev : a channel for technical discussion on Representable. We also generally post weekly sync updates in this channel.
 - /#representable-outreach : a channel for anything outreach â€” setting up calls, debriefing calls, questions, etc

### Notion
 Here's a link [Representable Workspace](https://www.notion.so/Representable-Workspace-b8845183ecfc4c93a9c7f626a744e12e) to our current repository of notes/docs/spreadsheets/most other stuff, Notion! (I'd recommend bookmarking this page, or downloading the app, since you'll likely be using Notion somewhat frequently) If you aren't familiar with Notion, it's got an excellent interface that can make it a bit easier than Google Drive to create, keep, and organize things like meeting notes. Feel free to poke around. There's a few places in particular which will be worth looking into.

 - [Terms to know](https://www.notion.so/Terms-to-know-22fb71a10c2d4c0ea359d65c3142cd61) : a list of relevant terms in gerrymandering that are especially likely to come up in outreach calls / are good to know in general!
 - [OKRs and Roadmaps](https://www.notion.so/e62a539578df4ed79583b4f4c6cd9c48?v=f775ba651f254fb8bd34831f41bc4371) : our current Objectives and Key Results will be kept here, in spreadsheet and document form. We set OKRs at the beginning of every new period, and they dictate how we move forward. We like to be ambitious, but realistic, when setting OKRs.
 - [Representable Progress Tracker](https://www.notion.so/Representable-Progress-Tracker-52f95e46c3b14a5e969361530ae6d84b) : Updated this weekly / at any milestone, with the details of what we've accomplished & what we're working on. If, at any point, you need to recall something we've been working on or reference the timing of a specific feature, it should be in here.

### Representable Google Drive
We used to keep all our notes here, before switching to Notion. It's still got a lot of our public facing content, our slide decks, and other good stuff. If you're interested in reading more on gerrymandering in general feel free to peruse the resources folder, which has been filled with a lot of articles of various types.

I recommend starring the drive folder, so it's easy to find in the future!

### Representable email
We have it set up so that emails sent to team@representable.org are automatically forwarded to our personal emails. This is done through Namecheap, under Domains and Email Forwarding.
