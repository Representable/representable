title: Non-Technical Setup
---

Here's some information for setting up the non-technical side of Representable.

Many of these are links which will be personally given out in order to keep them private, but use this checklist to ensure that you get connected to everything.

### Representable Groupchat
We use Messenger for casual discussion + occasional logistics. You will be added by a current team member.

### Slack
Our primary communication is via the Princeton Gerrymandering Project slack, some with the folks at PGP (Hannah, Jason, Adam, and Indraneel are who we have the most contact with). There's a few channels that it will be good for yall to join:

 - /#representable : general discussion on Representable. Links, contacts, anything goes here!
 - /#representable-dev : a channel for technical discussion on Representable. We also generally post weekly sync updates in this channel.
 - /#representable-team : a private channel of just us!
 - /#representable-bugs : a place to post and discuss bugs
 - /#representable-outreach : a channel for anything outreach â€” setting up calls, debriefing calls, questions, etc

### Notion
 Here's a link [Representable Workspace](https://www.notion.so/Representable-Workspace-b8845183ecfc4c93a9c7f626a744e12e) to our current repository of notes/docs/spreadsheets/most other stuff, Notion! (I'd recommend bookmarking this page, or downloading the app, since you'll likely be using Notion somewhat frequently) If you aren't familiar with Notion, it's got an excellent interface that can make it a bit easier than Google Drive to create, keep, and organize things like meeting notes. Feel free to poke around. There's a few places in particular which will be worth looking into.

 - [Terms to know](https://www.notion.so/Terms-to-know-22fb71a10c2d4c0ea359d65c3142cd61) : a list of relevant terms in gerrymandering that are especially likely to come up in outreach calls / are good to know in general!
 - [OKRs](https://www.notion.so/e62a539578df4ed79583b4f4c6cd9c48?v=f775ba651f254fb8bd34831f41bc4371) : our current Objectives and Key Results will be kept here, in spreadsheet and document form. We set OKRs at the beginning of every new period, and they dictate how we move forward. We like to be ambitious, but realistic, when setting OKRs.
 - [Feature Roadmap](https://www.notion.so/64d5edfe8d3b4ab0a30d625ca51dfaf1?v=77d478a06f0449b5a7544be86308a04b) : This holds all of our current and future features we plan to add. Update it whenever you find a new feature that we think we should work on! Weekly, we'll go through it and assign what hasn't been assigned as of yet.
 - [Bugs Doc](https://www.notion.so/54f21289a8624d6fbbbfc046e0f469c2?v=98b1ebb3a68e47dc93083753da9d6391) : Where we keep track of the latest bugs, who is working on them, and what still needs to be fixed!

### Representable Google Drive
[Here's a link.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1guPgFXTg8yu2sVqDu_tFCPd8Lt3HKuG5). We used to keep all our notes here, before switching to Notion. It's still got a lot of our public facing content, our slide decks, and other good stuff. If you're interested in reading more on gerrymandering in general feel free to peruse the resources folder, which has been filled with a lot of articles of various types.

I recommend starring the drive folder, so it's easy to find in the future!

### Representable email
We have it set up so that emails sent to team@representable.org are automatically forwarded to our personal emails. This is done through cloudflare apps. You should be set up for this as well!
Link is in the Bitwarden.
