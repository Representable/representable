# Representable

Representable is creating maps of communities to fight for equal and impartial representation. The core web app is written in Django with Javascript/HTML/CSS frontend and Postgres/PostGIS backend. Our mapping & visualization app, currently in beta, is written in React & built using `createreactapp` and `Material UI`.
