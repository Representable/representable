Thank you for using Representable!

You have downloaded your community/communities as a CSV file. A Block Equivalency CSV file is a standardized format for displaying census geographies.
It is compatible with other mapping softwares such as Maptitude for Redistricting, Dave's Redistricting App, and more.
CSV files exported from Representable contain two columns: BLOCKID and DISTRICTID. The BLOCKID contains the FIPS code of a Census Block from the 2020 Census
for all states other than Oklahoma and Illinois (which use 2010 FIPS codes). The DISTRICTID contains an ID which aligns to a community.

When utilizing community maps for drawing districts, doing analysis, or any other use, we believe that it is imperative to consider
the qualitative input a community author provides when filling out the survey flow of Representable. Communities are not just maps,
but the interests and concerns that bind people together. Please consult the interests and concerns of the community while utilizing this COI map.
For reference, the questions users are asked are repeated below, corresponding to the requisite sections of the community information when visualized on Representable.
