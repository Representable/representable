Thank you for using Representable!

You have downloaded your community/communities as a GeoJSON file. A GeoJSON file is a standardized format for displaying geographies.
It is compatible with other mapping softwares such as Maptitude for Redistricting, Dave's Redistricting App, and more.

The properties field contains the following variables:

 - census_block_ids: if the community is made of census blocks, the Census FIPS codes of the units that comprise the community

When utilizing community maps for drawing districts, doing analysis, or any other use, we believe that it is imperative to consider
the qualitative input a community author provides when filling out the survey flow of Representable. Communities are not just maps,
but the interests and concerns that bind people together.
