      <h5>Redistricting in Michigan</h5>
      <p>Michigan has a new Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission voted into law in 2018 by the people of this State. Representable will help you tell the Commission about your Community and draw a map of your Community boundaries so the Commission can fairly consider your Community when it draws new voting district lines.</p>
      <p>In the past, voting districts were drawn by politicians and their consultants behind closed doors with little public input.  However, the shape of voting district maps can influence election outcomes, so it is important that new district maps be drawn in a fair and impartial manner.</p>
      <h5 class="border-top pt-3">The Michigan Constitution now requires that voting district maps drawn by the new Commission meet seven criteria, ranked in order of priority.</h5>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <ol>
            <li>Districts shall be of equal population and comply with the Voting Rights Act,</li>
            <li>Districts shall be geographically contiguous (that is, all in one piece, not broken apart),</li>
            <li>Districts shall reflect the state’s diverse population and <b>communities of interest,</b></li>
            <li>Districts shall not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party,</li>
            <li>Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or candidate,</li>
            <li>District shall reflect consideration of county, city and township boundaries, and</li>
            <li>Districts shall be reasonably compact.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="border-top pt-2">Third on this list is the requirement for the new Commission to consider the state’s diverse populations and <b>“communities of interest”</b> . A Community is defined in the Michigan Constitution as populations that share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. A Community does not include relationships with political parties, incumbents or political candidates.
