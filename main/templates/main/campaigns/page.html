      <h4>General Information about MI Redistricting Efforts</h4>
      <p>In 2021, a group of Michigan citizens will convene as part of the Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission to draw new state legislative and congressional districts. These district maps will inform how citizens vote, how much their votes matter, and which politicians win elections to represent communities for the next 10 years!</p>
      <p>In order to make sure these new district lines are fair and impartial, it’s important that the citizens on the Redistricting Commission have public input from as many Michiganders as possible on where their communities are and what binds them together. If mapmakers have your community information, they’re less likely to split your community apart.</p>
