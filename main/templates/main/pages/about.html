      We’re a team of engineers and policy researchers
      who are excited to create technical solutions for civic issues.
      Coming from a wide array of backgrounds, we put our technical and policy experience
      together to make a powerful crowdsourced tool which we hope can change the current
      polarized political landscape of how districts are made in the United States.
      We’re committed to giving a voice to those who have been marginalized or politically
      diluted by gerrymandering and look forward to turning Representable into a national
      tool for political equity.
