  <h4>What is Districter?</h4>
  <p>Districter is an online service that allows Americans to fight against gerrymandering by
    drawing their communities of interest (COIs) on a map. A COI is what a person consider to
    be their community. This can take the form of a coastal neighborhood that stretches along a
    beach, or a valley village that is clustered around a river. Currently, people can only provide
    qualitative information through committee hearings, which cannot be easily used to draw
    districts or highlight gerrymandering. Allowing people to mark their COIs will help redistricting
    committees by providing them with quantifiable information that can be used to draw fair
    districts. Furthermore, Districter will provide a way to better visualize and quantify the current
    state of gerrymandering by overlaying district lines over communities of interest.</p>
