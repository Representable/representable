      <h3>What is Districter?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Districter is an online service that allows citizens to fight against gerrymandering by
crowdsourcing maps of their communities of interest (COIs). A COI is what citizens consider to
be their community. This can take the form of a coastal neighborhood that stretches along a
beach, or a valley village that is clustered around a river. Currently, citizens can only provide
qualitative information through committee hearings, which cannot be easily used to draw
districts or highlight gerrymandering. Allowing citizens to mark their COIs will help redistricting
committees by providing them with quantifiable information that can be used to draw fair
districts. Furthermore, Districter will provide a way to better visualize and quantify the current
state of gerrymandering by overlaying district lines over communities of interest.</p>
