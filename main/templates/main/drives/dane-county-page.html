                        The law also requires that electoral districts are equal in population, and keep municipalities intact.  
                        For the first time ever, Dane County has appointed a nonpartisan, independent Redistricting Commission to guide and direct that process.  
                        This will help ensure that supervisory districts are drawn impartially, without regard to politics.{% endblocktrans %}

        Dane County's ordinance requires that: <br><br><em>"District lines shall keep intact neighborhoods and communities with established ties of common interest and
        association whether historical, racial, economic, ethnic, religious or other."</em><br><br>
        Communities as described above don't always fall neatly into existing, easily mapped areas such as municipal boundaries, school districts, census block groups,
        or neighborhood associations. The Redistricting Commission needs your help to make sure your community is adequately represented.
